# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

# 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

# (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

# A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
#
# a**2 + b**2 = c**2
# For example, 3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.
#
# There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
# Find the product abc. answer 10 18 24 = 31875000
